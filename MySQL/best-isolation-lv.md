# Which is best isolation level for a common situation

MySQL supports several isolation levels, each of which defines how the database engine should handle concurrent transactions. The best option for a common situation depends on the specific needs of your application.

Here are the most common isolation levels in MySQL, along with their characteristics:

READ UNCOMMITTED: This isolation level allows dirty reads, meaning that transactions can read uncommitted changes made by other transactions. It is not recommended for most applications, as it can result in inconsistent data.

READ COMMITTED: This isolation level allows transactions to read only committed data, which prevents dirty reads. However, it can still result in non-repeatable reads and phantom reads, as other transactions can commit changes between the reads.

REPEATABLE READ: This isolation level guarantees that a transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the database, even if other transactions make changes. It prevents non-repeatable reads and phantom reads, but it still allows for a small window for new data to be inserted into the transaction.

SERIALIZABLE: This isolation level provides the highest level of isolation by locking all the rows that a transaction accesses until the transaction is complete. This prevents all forms of concurrency-related anomalies, but it can also lead to reduced concurrency and performance.

In general, the REPEATABLE READ isolation level is a good default option for most applications, as it strikes a balance between consistency and performance. However, if your application requires a higher level of consistency, you may want to consider using SERIALIZABLE. If you need to prioritize performance over consistency, you may want to consider using READ COMMITTED or READ UNCOMMITTED, but be aware of the potential risks and trade-offs.
